# Flask with GraphQL 

Quick and easy implementation of python flask and facebook's graphql. 

## Getting Started

Clone this repo to your machine and pip install -r requirements.txt to get up and running. There are multiple examples depending on your experience level. I would suggest starting with the basic_query and progress to add_add, add_custom_name, and then either of the server files. Both contain the same code however, server_with_notes has, you guessed it, notes to explain whats going on. 

## Installation

Confirm prior to installing you are running python 2.7. I wrote this with that syntax in mind.

Clone this repo to your local machine and then pip install -r requirements.txt. 

Then run 

```
EXPORT FLASK_APP=server.py
```
'''
flask run
'''
